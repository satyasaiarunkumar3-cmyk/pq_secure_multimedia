Web-Based End-to-End Post-Quantum Secure Multimedia Messaging System Using Kyber Cryptography
The rapid evolution of quantum computing presents a serious security challenge to traditional public-key cryptographic algorithms such as RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), which form the backbone of modern secure communication systems. Quantum algorithms, particularly Shor’s algorithm, have the potential to break these classical cryptographic schemes in polynomial time. Consequently, there is an urgent need for quantum-resistant communication systems capable of protecting sensitive data in the post-quantum era.
This project proposes a web-based end-to-end secure multimedia messaging system that leverages post-quantum cryptography to ensure future-proof security. The system utilizes a Kyber-based key generation mechanism, a lattice-based post-quantum cryptographic scheme, to establish secure shared keys between communicating users. To achieve high performance and low latency, AES-GCM symmetric encryption is employed for encrypting text messages as well as multimedia content, including images, audio, video, and document files.
The application follows a WhatsApp-like communication model, providing user authentication, secure registration, sender-receiver selection, encrypted message transmission, and persistent chat history. All messages are encrypted at the sender’s end and decrypted only at the receiver’s end, ensuring that the server acts solely as a message relay and cannot access plaintext data.
The proposed system demonstrates that post-quantum cryptography can be effectively integrated into real-world web applications without compromising usability or performance. This work highlights the feasibility of deploying quantum-resistant secure communication platforms for next-generation digital communication systems.
